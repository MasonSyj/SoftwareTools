The University of Bristol Hoverboard Society (HovSoc) wants to create a database to manage its membership and events. Each member has a name, an optional student number, a contact e-mail address and a hoverboard riding skill level (represented as an integer, minimum 0). We assume that e-mail addresses are unique among members.

The committee consists of some of the members, each of which has a unique committee role. We assume that committee roles do not change during the year and that each committee role must be filled every year.

An event has a date, a name, a location, an optional description and an organiser who must be a society member (not necessarily a committee member). An event is attended by a set of members. There is never more than one event at the same location on the same date but event names are not unique.
